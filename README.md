# flip

I started a training log from rock climbing, but each day I appended to the bottom.
I wish I would have appended to the top, so I don't have to scroll down to add new entries,
which is mostly how I interact with it. 

This is a script to sort the bullet points and sections in the opposite order: flip 'em. 

## Approach

The training log is pretty structured. Sections are separated by `\n\n`. 
And sections that are bullet points that start with dates should ran
in ascending order.
